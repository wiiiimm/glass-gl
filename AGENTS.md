# AGENTS.md

Guidance for AI coding agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, etc.) working in this repo.
`CLAUDE.md` is a symlink to this file — keep all agent guidance here.

## Release & commit workflow (see `.claude/skills/`)

This repo uses Conventional Commits + semantic-release, with **pooled releases** and a
**`production` branch** gate. Installed skills carry the details — load them when relevant:

- **conventional-commits** — every commit/PR title is `type(scope): description`
  (`feat`/`fix`/… ; `feat!` or a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer for majors). This is what drives
  automated version bumps and the changelog, so non-conventional commits break releases.
- **semantic-release-automation** — versioning, CHANGELOG, tags, GitHub Releases, and npm
  publish are automated from those commits (package: `packages/glass-gl`).
- **pooled-release** — we do NOT release on every merge to `main`. Releases are **pooled**
  (cut on demand / on a cadence) so each release has one readable changelog.
- **production-release-gating** — `main` is development; the **`production` branch** is the
  promotion gate (only a real release/promotion ships prod, not every commit).

Practical rule: commit to `main` with conventional messages; cut a pooled release when ready;
promote to `production` to ship. Don't wire "publish on every push to main."

## What this project is

A **glass UI toolkit** distributed through several channels at once, from a single repo:

1. An **AI skill** (`SKILL.md`) teaching how to build glassmorphism / liquid-glass UI.
2. A **CSS package** (`glass.css`) shippable via npm + CDN.
3. A **shadcn registry** so people `npx shadcn add <url>` the React components.
4. A **Claude Code plugin** (installable via a marketplace manifest).
5. A **docs + demo website** (Next.js on Vercel) modeled on glasscn-components.vercel.app.

The unique angle: glass at **three fidelity tiers**, in one place —
- **Tier 1 — CSS `backdrop-filter` blur** (frosted; what most libraries stop at)
- **Tier 2 — SVG `feDisplacementMap`** (real refraction/bending, no canvas)
- **Tier 3 — WebGL fragment shader** (per-frame refraction lens; showpieces/exports)

Most competing libraries are tier-1 only. Tiers 2–3 are the differentiator — protect them.

## Naming status (DECISION PENDING — do not hardcode prematurely)

The product name is **not finalized**. Shortlist: `Refract` / `Vitre` / `Lucent Glass` /
scoped `@wiiiimm/glass-ui`. Until decided, the repo folder is `glass-ui-kit` (placeholder).
When the name lands, it must be set consistently in: `package.json`, the plugin manifest,
the marketplace manifest, the shadcn registry, the site, and the skill's `name:` field.
**If you touch publishing config, check whether the name is still a placeholder first.**

## Repository layout

Current (built):
- `plugins/glass-ui/skills/glass-ui/` — the canonical **skill** (SKILL.md, README, references/, assets/). **Single source of truth** for the glass technique + `glass.css`.
- `plugins/glass-ui/.claude-plugin/` and `.claude-plugin/` — Claude plugin + marketplace manifests (to be written).
- `src/ui/` — canonical React component source (to be written).
- `public/` — built static output for Vercel (registry JSON, demo) (to be generated).

Planned (not yet built):
- `site/` (or `app/`) — Next.js docs + demo website (Fumadocs or Nextra + shadcn).
- `registry.json` + `public/r/*.json` — shadcn registry, built with `shadcn build`.
- `.github/workflows/` — CI to publish npm, deploy the site, rebuild the registry.

## Canonical sources & the no-drift rule

- The **CSS** lives once at `plugins/glass-ui/skills/glass-ui/assets/glass.css`. Other
  channels (npm, site, registry) must **copy from** it via a build step, never fork it.
- The **skill** is the source of truth for technique docs. The website's docs should be
  generated from / kept in sync with the skill's `references/*.md`, not rewritten.
- If you change the glass recipe, update `glass.css` first, then propagate.

## Conventions

- Always ship the `-webkit-` prefix for `backdrop-filter`, and the `@supports` /
  `prefers-reduced-transparency` fallbacks. Glass without fallbacks is a bug here.
- Tier 2 (SVG `url()` on backdrop-filter) is **flaky in Safari** — always provide a blur
  fallback. Never ship a refraction demo that's blank in Safari.
- Glass is **only visible over a busy/colorful background** — every demo/example must place
  glass over a gradient or image, never a flat color.
- Keep `SKILL.md` lean; put depth in `references/`. Match existing file style.

## How to verify changes (glass is visual — look, don't just read)

```bash
# serve the skill's live demo
python3 -m http.server 8000 --directory plugins/glass-ui/skills/glass-ui/assets
# open http://localhost:8000/example.html — check: backdrop visibly blurs (tier 1),
# the refraction card bends the gradient (tier 2), text stays legible, rim highlight shows.
```
Test in both a Chromium browser and Safari (tier-2 fallback) before claiming it works.

## Distribution mechanics (for reference)

- **npm/CDN**: `npm publish` the CSS; usable via jsDelivr/unpkg with no install.
- **shadcn**: `shadcn build` compiles `registry.json` → `public/r/*.json`; users run
  `npx shadcn add <site-url>/r/<item>.json`. "Publishing" = deploying the site.
- **Claude plugin**: the repo *is* the marketplace (via `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`);
  users add it with `/plugin marketplace add <repo>`. No separate publish step.
- **Skill marketplaces** (mcpmarket, lobehub, claudemarketplaces): these **index public
  repos**; you don't push to them. Getting listed is a one-time submission / they auto-crawl.

## Reference material (not part of the shipped repo)

The competitive research and downloaded peer projects live OUTSIDE this repo at
`../glass-ui/_reference/` with a comparison in `_reference/NOTES.md`. The original studied
liquid-glass card is at `../glass-ui/bubbbly/`. Do not copy peer code into this repo; study
and reimplement.
